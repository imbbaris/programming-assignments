# Assignment 4: Introduction to Python Programming

## Objective

This assignment focuses on learning basic Python programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, data types, lists, and user inputs. The project is divided into five tasks, each with scripts and documentation.

There are four components (3 `folders` and 1 `.md` file) here:

1. **`scripts`**

   This folder contains 5 Python scripts:
   - `arithmetic_operations.py`: Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.
   - `output_to_file.py`: Performs arithmetic operations and redirects output to a file.
   - `print_and_input.py`: Showcases the use of `print` and `input` functions.
   - `data_types.py`: Illustrates different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
   - `lists_operations.py`: Creates and manipulates lists in Python.

2. **`figures`**

   This folder contains screenshots documenting the Python scripts:
   - `arithmetic_operations.png`: Shows `arithmetic_operations.py` and its output.
   - `output_to_file.png`: Displays `output_to_file.py` and its output file.
   - `print_and_input.png`: Shows `print_and_input.py` with sample input/output.
   - `data_types.png`: Displays `data_types.py` and its output.
   - `lists_operations.png`: Shows `lists_operations.py` and its output.

3. **`documents`**

   This folder contains:
   - `arithmetic_operations.txt`: Output of `arithmetic_operations.py`.
   - `output_to_file.txt`: Output of `output_to_file.py`.

4. **`README.md`**

   This `README.md` file provides an overview of the assignment and its components.
