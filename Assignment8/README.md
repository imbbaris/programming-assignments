# Assignment 8: Data Visualization Using Gnuplot

## Overview

The Assignment8 folder contains:

1. **`data.txt`**: A dataset derived from a scientific paper for generating a thermal management plot for a lithium-ion battery.

2. **`li-on_battery_paper.gp`**: A Gnuplot script used to process `data.txt` and generate a validation plot in GIF format.

3. **`validation.gif`**: A graphical output generated by running the Gnuplot script, to be compared with the reference image.

4. **`README.md`**: This file provides a summary of the contents and instructions for completing the assignment.

## Objectives

- Learn to visualize data using Gnuplot.
- Understand the steps required to process data files and produce meaningful graphical outputs.
- Gain experience in verifying outputs by comparing them to reference visuals.

## Summary of the Task

Students will download the provided dataset (`data.txt`) and copy the given Gnuplot script into a file named `li-on_battery_paper.gp`. By running this script, they will generate a validation plot (`validation.gif`) and ensure it matches the reference image provided.

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed skills in using Gnuplot for data visualization.
- Learned how to work with datasets and scripting to create scientific plots.
- Enhanced understanding of the importance of validation and reproducibility in scientific computing.
