# Assignment 3: Advanced Shell Scripting and Workflow Automation

## Objective

This assignment focuses on improving your shell scripting skills and workflow automation using the terminal. The project is divided into four components, each containing scripts and documentation for the tasks.

There are four components (3 `folders` and 1 `.md` file) here:

1. **`scripts`**

   This folder contains 4 shell scripts:
   - `create_files.sh`: A script to create directories and files and write content into those files.
   - `loops.sh`: A script demonstrating loop operations in shell scripting.
   - `conditions.sh`: A script demonstrating conditional statements in shell scripting.
   - `operations.sh`: A script showcasing basic arithmetic operations.

2. **`documents`**

   This folder contains:
   - `exercise.txt`: A text file where content is written using shell commands as part of the assignment.

3. **`figures`**

   This folder contains 4 screenshots documenting your work with the shell scripts:
   - `create_files.png`: A screenshot of the terminal running the `create_files.sh` script.
   - `loops.png`: A screenshot of the terminal running the `loops.sh` script.
   - `conditions.png`: A screenshot of the terminal running the `conditions.sh` script.
   - `operations.png`: A screenshot of the terminal running the `operations.sh` script.

4. **`README.md`**

   This `README.md` file contains the instructions and overview of the assignment and its components.
