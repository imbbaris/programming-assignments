# Assignment7: Text-Based Adventure Game

## Overview

The Assignment7 folder contains:

1. **`forestTreasure.py`**: A Python script that implements a text-based adventure game. 
The game uses `if` statements to create branching storylines and a `for` loop to perform meaningful operations, such as displaying a list of items or numbers. 
Players make choices to navigate through the story, leading to different outcomes based on their decisions.

2. **`README.md`**: This file provides a summary of the contents and objectives of Assignment7.

## Objectives

- Practice using `if/elif/else` statements for decision-making and branching logic.

- Learn how to incorporate `for` loops into a meaningful game scenario.

- Create a program that gracefully handles user input and provides logical responses to player choices.

- Design a simple yet interactive game to engage users while practicing fundamental programming concepts.

## Summary of the Game

The adventure game begins at the edge of a forest. 
Players make choices to explore paths, interact with objects in a hut, and solve a puzzle. 
Success depends on navigating the story carefully and correctly solving the final puzzle using the knowledge gained in the game.

## Learning Outcomes

- Mastered the use of conditional logic (`if` statements) in Python.

- Gained experience with iteration (`for` loops) in practical applications.

- Developed a better understanding of interactive programming and user input handling.
