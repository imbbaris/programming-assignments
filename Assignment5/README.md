# Assignment 5: Python Modules and Numpy Operations

## Objective

This assignment focuses on learning Python modules and fundamental operations in `numpy`, including file system operations, command-line argument parsing, mathematical functions, and matrix manipulations. The project is divided into five tasks, each with scripts and documentation.

There are four components (3 `folders` and 1 `.md` file) here:

1. **`scripts`**

This folder contains 6 Python scripts:

   - `os_operations.py`: Demonstrates file system operations using the `os` module.
   - `argparse_example.py`: Parses command-line arguments using `argparse`.
   - `math_operations.py`: Performs mathematical operations using the `math` module.
   - `numpy_basics.py`: Basic `numpy` operations including addition, dot product, and element-wise multiplication.
   - `numpy_advanced.py`: Advanced `numpy` operations, including reshaping, stacking arrays, and extracting specific elements.

2. **`documents`**

This folder contains output files for each script:

   - `os_operations_output.txt`: Output of `os_operations.py`.
   - `argparse_output.txt`: Output of `argparse_example.py`.
   - `math_operations_output.txt`: Output of `math_operations.py`.
   - `numpy_basics_output.txt`: Output of `numpy_basics.py`.
   - `numpy_advanced_output.txt`: Output of `numpy_advanced.py`.

3. **`README.md`**

   This `README.md` file provides an overview of the Assignment 5 and its components.
